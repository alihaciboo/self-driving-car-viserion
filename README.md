# 								Viserion

This is a repository for SJSU CMPE 243 - Viserion project group.
The Master branch has been cloned from the Professor Preetpal Kang's 
https://gitlab.com/preet/lpc1758_freertos git repository

**Always use git bash to push/pull from the main directory (Do not use Eclipse)**

- Viserion.dbc will be the dbc file that will be shared by all 5 projects.
- dbc_parse.py is also decoupled from each internal directory so that it will be easier to change if required in future.
- prebuild.sh of every project has been modified to find the python script and dbc file in the main directory.
- /_can_dbc path has been added to search paths of every project so that there are no errors when the autogenerated header file is included.
